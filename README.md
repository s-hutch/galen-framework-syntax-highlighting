# Galen Syntax Highlighting for Sublime Text

Basic syntax highlighting for v2.x.x of the [Galen Framework](http://galenframework.com/) for Sublime Text.

## Installation

There are two methods, 1 is to use Package Control the other is to install manually. To install via Package Control:

1. [Install Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) if you haven't already.
2. Use cmd+shift+P (or ctrl+shift+P for Windows) then select Package Control: Install Package
3. Search for Galen and select to install

To install manually:

1. Click the Preferences > Browse Packagesâ€¦ menu
2. Browse up a folder and then into the Installed Packages/ folder
3. Download the zip archive, extract the zip and rename it to Galen.sublime-package and copy it into the Packages/User directory
4. Optional step if galen doesn't show in the list of languages in the bottom right, restart Sublime Text.

## Usage

This project adds highlighting to .gspec files, assuming no other syntax highlighting plugin is installed for that file extension. Once installed there should be "Galen" in the lower right hand corner of Sublime Text when a .gspec file is open, but in case of a conflict, click whatever syntax label you see there and select "Galen" from the resulting menu.
